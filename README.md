# xGradio-based CSV Question Answering and Visualization Application
This Python script creates a CSV Question Answering & Visualization App using Gradio, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Ollama (for LLM-based analysis). The app allows users to:

1. Upload a CSV file.
2. Ask a question about the data.
3. Select two columns to generate a plot.
4. Receive an answer from an LLM (Ollama) based on the data.
5. View a generated graph of the selected columns.


## Code Breakdown
### 1. Importing Libraries
gradio: Creates an interactive UI.
pandas: Handles CSV data.
matplotlib.pyplot: Generates plots.
ollama: Calls the LLM model for answering queries.
io: Helps read binary files.

### 2.Function to Answer User Queries Using LLM
Takes a user question and the first five rows of the CSV.
Sends the data and question to Ollamaâ€™s LLM (llama3.1).
Handles errors in the API response.
Returns the model's response or an error message.

### 3.Function to Generate a Graph
Checks if the selected columns exist in the CSV.
Creates a line plot (matplotlib).
Saves the plot as plot.png and returns the file path.

### 4.Function to Process CSV & Generate LLM Answer + Plot
1. Reads the uploaded CSV file.
2. Calls ask_llm() to get an answer based on the data.
3. Calls generate_plot() to create a graph.
4. Returns both the LLM response and the plot path.

### 5.Gradio UI Setup
A. Creates a Gradio interface with:
   1. File upload input (CSV).
   2. Text input for user questions.
   3. Text inputs for X and Y columns.
   4. A submit button to process the CSV.
   5. Textbox for LLM response.
   6. Image display for the generated graph.
B. Connects the submit button to the process_csv() function.

### 6. Running the App
Starts the Gradio app when the script is run.
Prints a local URL where the app is hosted (http://127.0.0.1:7860).

### Result of Running the Code
1. The app starts locally at http://127.0.0.1:7860.
2. Users can upload a CSV file, ask a question, and specify columns for visualization.
3. The app returns:
a. A text-based answer from the LLM (Ollama) based on the CSV.
b. A plot showing the relationship between the selected columns.
